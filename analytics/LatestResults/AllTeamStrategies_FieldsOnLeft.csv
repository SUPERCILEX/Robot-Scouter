,Never seen them play defense.,Not very effective ,,,"Good at blocking. Never got penalties (except for that one time :). Not as mobile, so they have trouble blocking swerve robots. ",Did well in finals when playing defense 
,,,"Shoot close to the tarmac tape.
Can easily get rid of a wrong color ball.",,In the first couple qual matches their robot stopped working. Very bouncy and tippy when stopping.,It takes them awhile to line up to shoot. They always shoot from just outside the tarmac tape. It looks like they have trouble moving around when they are near the power cord on the floor. They don't do well when they have defense against them.
