4418,03-20-2022,NG,True,Unknown ,4-Shoot + Taxi + Intake (2 Cargo max),"Shoot low, then taxi to pick up another ball, then come back against the hub to shoot that ball.

They always shoot from just outside the tarmac tape. It looks like they have trouble moving around when they are near the power cord on the floor. They don't do well when they have defense against them.
