Fix a bunch of scout template bugs:
    - Scout templates are no longer deleted when all teams are deleted
    - Fix bug where creating a new team on a device that didn't create the template wouldn't use it
    - Fix crash when editing a deleted template on another device
    - Fix crash when creating new template
    - Fix bug where tapping the reset template buttons would also tap the list of metrics behind them
