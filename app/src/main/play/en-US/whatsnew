Robot Scouter v1.1 is out!!! Here are just a few of the highlights:
    - The spreadsheet exporting experience has been completely resigned
    - Added charts to the spreadsheet
    - Made long team names look much better in tablet mode
    - You can now add pictures of a team's robot directly from Robot Scouter! On top of that, those pictures can be shared with The Blue Alliance to help the greater community! ðŸŽ‰
